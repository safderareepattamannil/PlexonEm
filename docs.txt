     How.To.Train.Your.Dragon.2010.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG
     Kingsman.The.Golden.Circle.2017.720p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG
    - store original name for look up in folder for movie file
    - probably look for first 4 numbers in a row then see if there is a dot that follows
    - strip all characters after 
    - then remove all periods
    - insert parenthesis around the 4 numbers in a row to create format title (year)
    - store that name 

- Then go into folder and rename the file with the original parent name 

- loop over all files to do this 
- clear all metadata from file
